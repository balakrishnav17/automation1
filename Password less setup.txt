how to do password less setup
first create sg for bastion server
after apache and nginx server assign bastion sg to both servers
First create bastion server 
apache server
nginx server

1 passwordless setup for all servers
first we have change hostnames for all servers
and we have to create alia command
for connecting servers

ssh='/root/scripts/sshlogin.sh/(Here we have to give the file path of the script wr it is)
and passwd authentication we have tom change two files

1 vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config file here we have to do copy paste of that particular user id
ike devopsadmin
after that we have to restart the service 
service sshd restart by using this command we can restart
2 file is visudo
here 65 line we have to change yes

and we have to generate ssh-keygen after generated the key we have to copy both apache and nginx servers
like jenkins and tomcat also we ahve to do passwordless setup and sshkeygen

for copying sshkeygen ssh-copy-id servername(apache,nginx)

in all servers one userid must be same name like devopsadmin
